**Foodora Eats Restaurant Analytics (Dataverse Case Study)**
This repository contains the analysis and deliverables for the Dataverse Business Analytics Challenge Foodora Eats case. The objective is to use a real world multi country restaurant dataset to diagnose quality and engagement gaps and recommend actions to improve discovery and customer experience.

**Project overview**
Analysed 9.5k restaurants × 22 features across multiple countries using Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib).
Merged Foodora Data.csv with Country Code.xlsx, cleaned missing cuisines and duplicates, and created derived country, city, locality, cuisine, and operational metrics.
Delivered a 3slide deck summarising Data Understanding, Key Insights, and Recommendations for Foodora Eats.
​
**Key analyses & insights**
Country & city performance: India emerges as a high engagement but under optimised market (many restaurants and high votes per restaurant, but ratings below global benchmark).
New Delhi deep dive: Largest city by restaurant count with strong engagement yet low average rating, making it the highest leverage city for quality uplift and curation.
Locality clusters: Localities such as Shahdara, Mayur Vihar Phase 1, Mahipalpur, Krishna Nagar, and Mukherjee Nagar are high supply, low rating zones, ideal for targeted interventions.
Cuisine matrix (Delhi): Core high‑demand cuisines (North Indian, Chinese, Fast Food, Mughlai) show systemic quality gaps despite strong demand and votes.
Operational levers: Online delivery and table booking strongly correlate with higher ratings and higher votes; ultra‑low price segments often show quality trade‑offs vs. mid‑range “value for money”.
Hidden gems: Rule‑based logic identifies highly rated, affordable, low‑visibility restaurants, supporting a “Hidden Gems” discovery layer and quality‑weighted ranking strategy.
